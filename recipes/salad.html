	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>In the period from 1940s wartime ‘dig for Britain’ allotments and the 1990s, lettuce were the only green salad leaves generally available to the British. Spinach was something Popeye drank from a can, rocket was a technology we sold to the Americans, and Radicchio was the Italian kid who had moved next door and his parents had an ice cream van.</p>
	<p>This is where the classic English salad comes from. Dad would lift a lettuce from the garden, and this would be dressed up with a range of immovable accompaniments including tomatoes, cucumber, radish and boiled eggs. The whole thing would be spooned over with Heinz Salad Cream.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2–3 gem or cos lettuce, leaved and washed</li>
		<li>6 tomatoes, quartered</li>
