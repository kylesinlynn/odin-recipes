	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Patatas bravas are the classic side that literally everyone orders when out for Spanish tapas. They never fail to satisfy, they are suitable for vegetarians, and they are beloved by all.</p>
	<p>This invention of patatas bravas is tied firmly to the Spanish conquest of the Inca civilisation in the 50 years following 1532. This was the point at which the European continent first got to know about potatoes.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>2 good-sized Maris Piper potatoes</li>
		<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>2 tsp paprika</li>
		<li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
		<li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
		<li>250ml vegetable stock</li>
		<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan until nice and hot. Throw in the potatoes, toss in the oil and sauté on medium for about 15–20 mins until golden on the outside, and cooked in the centre.</li>
		<li>While the potatoes are cooking, heat the olive oil in a small sauté pan.</li>
		<li>Once hot, remove from the heat briefly, to whisk in the paprika and cornflour. You are looking for a nice, homogenous paste. Put the pan back on the heat, and slowly add the stock, bit by bit, ensuring there are no lumps. You are looking for a thick sauce, and you may not use all the stock. Add the vinegar and whisk in. Season to taste.</li>
		<li>Finally, tip the potatoes into the sauce, stir to coat, and heat everything through. Serve.</li>
	</ol>
